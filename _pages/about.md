About Me
======

Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University, Milan, Italy. I work for the Bocconi 
Institute for Data Science and Analytics and I am a member of the team that is currently working on a [Twitter funded 
project](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation.html) to understand, explore and measure
how healthy the conversations on the platform are.

I like doing a lot of different things! I have different interests that range from neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning to natural language processing and from 
quantum physics to deep learning for the e-commerce.

During my PhD at Bicocca University I was very lucky and I got the chance to speak at different venues like Stanford University
and Monterey, California and at many other conferences.

I have papers in different AI venues (e.g., [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472),
 [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf), 
 [ISWC](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_4)) and Q1 Journals (e.g., 
[Nature PJQI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0248-6), [SWJ](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj2188.pdf)) and a few things have also been
 featured in press (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html), 
[2](https://www.photonics.com/Articles/Neural_Network_Improves_Quantum_Tomography/a65552), 
[3](https://www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu/notizia.php?idArt=21787)).

If you would like to contact me you can send me an [email](f.bianchi@unibocconi.it).

Bye :)
