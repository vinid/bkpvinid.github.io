Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University (with [Prof. Dirk Hovy](http://www.dirkhovy.com/)), Milan, Italy. I was a PhD Student at University of Milan-Bicocca ([Prof. Matteo Palmonari](http://inside.disco.unimib.it/index.php/people/matteo-palmonari/)) and 
a Visiting Scholar at [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/), Ohio, US ([Prof. Pascal Hitzler](http://www.pascal-hitzler.de/)).
I have experience in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

I work for the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics and I am a member of the team that is currently working on a [Twitter funded 
project](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation.html) to understand, explore and measure
how healthy the conversations on the platform are. I have introduced and worked with algorithms for artificial intelligence and for
data analytics over text.

During my PhD at Bicocca University I got the chance to speak at different venues like Stanford University
and Monterey, California and at many other conferences.

I like coding, and I love (functional) programming languages. I am a very happy emacs user.

Research Experience
-------------------

I like doing a lot of different things! I have different interests that range from neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning to natural language processing and from 
quantum physics to deep learning for the e-commerce.

I have papers in the main track of different AI venues (e.g., EACL, [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472),
 [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf), 
 [ISWC](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_4), [RecSys](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3383313.3411477)), workshop proceedings (WWW, [NeurIPS](https://github.com/orlrworkshop/orlrworkshop.github.io/blob/master/pdf/ORLR_12.pdf)) and Q1 Journals (e.g., 
[Nature PJQI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0248-6), [SWJ](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj2188.pdf)) and a few things have also been
 featured in press or in company media outlets (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html), 
[2](https://www.photonics.com/Articles/Neural_Network_Improves_Quantum_Tomography/a65552), 
[3](https://www.knowledge.unibocconi.eu/notizia.php?idArt=21787), 
[4](https://blog.coveo.com/multi-brand-personalization-in-ecommerce/)). 

I have also worked/collaborated with companies: I have collaborated as a Data Scientist for [Instal LLC](https://instal.com)  and I have an ongoing 
research collaboration with people at [Coveo](https://www.coveo.com/en) on e-commerce and recommendation research. In the past, 
I worked as a full-stack software developer for Mobave LLC (later acquired by Instal) and for Whattaspot.
