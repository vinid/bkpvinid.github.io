Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University, Milan, Italy. I work for the Bocconi 
Institute for Data Science and Analytics and I am a member of the team that is currently working on a [Twitter funded 
project](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation.html) to understand, explore and measure
how healty the conversations on the platform are.

I have different interests that ranges from neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning to natural language processing and from 
quantum physics to deep learning for the e-commerce.

My work has been published in several main AI venues (e.g., [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472),
 [ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf), 
 [ISWC](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00671-6_4)) and Q1 Journals (e.g., 
[Nature PJQI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0248-6), [SWJ](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj2188.pdf)) and it
has been also featured in press (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html),
