Hello! I am Federico Bianchi, a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University, Milan, Italy. I work for the Bocconi 
Institute for Data Science and Analytics and I am a member of the team that is currently working on a [Twitter funded 
project](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/measuring_healthy_conversation.html).

I have different interests that ranges from neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning to natural language processing and from 
quantum physics to deep learning for the e-commerce.

My work has been published in several main AI venues (e.g., AAAI, ACL, ISWC) and Q1 Journals (e.g., 
[Nature PJQI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-0248-6), SWJ) and it
has been also featured in press (see, [1](https://phys.org/news/2020-02-machine-quantum-optics.html),
