Got two papers accepted at NAACL2021!

First one is "Language in a (Search) Box: Grounding Language Learning in Real-World Human-Machine Interaction" where we show 
how we can learn compositionality in language from scratch by using real-world interaction between users and a search engine.
I am really happy about this work: it is based on the use of extra-textual elements that a lot of researcher are now pointing out
being crucial in advancing our comprehension of language acquisition and the notion of ``meaning''. 

The second one is a paper on hurtful messages, in language models. We empirically show that
language models like BERT are prone to create hurtful messages in gendered languages.
